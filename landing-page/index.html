      <h1>What is Agent Based Modeling?</h1>
      <p>Agent Based Modeling (ABM) is a tool for simulating natural and social phenomena, from the spread of wildfire to the ups and downs in the stock market.</p>
      <p>It has a ton of applications, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>in biology, to study predator/prey dynamics, coordination in ants and other super-organisms, and the immune system</li>
        <li>in ecology and land stewardship, to understand how fire, rain, erosion, and vegetation all effect each other</li>
        <li>in epidemiology, to study the spread of infection</li>
        <li>in urban planning, to simulate traffic congestion and evacuation</li>
        <li>in economics, to study financial markets and game theory</li>
        <li>in computer graphics, to animate schools of fish, flocks of birds, particle effects, and crowds</li>
      </ul>
      <p>People use agent-based models to understand the underlying principles of phenomena that have no central brain or authority.</p>
      <p>The basic idea is to give simple rules to a bunch of agents in an environment, let them loose, and see what happens!</p>

      <h1>What is Agentscript?</h1>
      
      <p>Agentscript is a javascript library for writing agent based models that run in your web browser. It is inspired by an incredible language called <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">Netlogo</a>.</p>

      <h2>Turtles, Patches, and Links</h2>
      <p>In Agentscript, there are three primary ingredients: turtles, patches, and links. We'll look at these one by one.</p>

      <p class="note">This tutorial assumes you have a little familiarity with javascript. If you have never seen javascript before, or if you want a refresher, try out this interactive tutorial: <a href="https://jgthms.com/javascript-in-14-minutes/" target="_blank">Javascript in 14 Minutes</a>.</p>
      
      <h2>Turtles</h2>
      
      <p>First things first, let's make a turtle:</p>
      <div code-block>model.turtles.create(1)</div>
      
      <p>Click the "run once" button to execute that code once.</p>
      <p>You'll see a turtle appear in the center of the world. It will look like a white chevron.</p>
      
      <p>Now that we have a turtle, we can ask it do something, like move forward:</p>
      <div code-block>model.turtles.ask(turtle => turtle.forward(1))</div>

      <p class="note">If you are familiar with javascript, it may help to know that <code>turtles.ask()</code> has the same meaning as <code>turtles.forEach()</code>.</p>

      <p>Or we can ask it to rotate:</p>
      <div code-block>model.turtles.ask(turtle => turtle.rotate(45))</div>

      <p>Or move forward, and then rotate:</p>
      <div code-block>model.turtles.ask(turtle => {
  turtle.forward(1)
  turtle.rotate(25)
})</div>

      <p>Try changing one of the numbers in the above code to make the turtle move farther away, or rotate more.</p>

      <p>Instead of working one step at a time, things get really interesting when you run a behavior over and over again.</p>

      <p>I added a "run forever" button to the code snippet above. Try it out!</p>

      <div code-block forever-button>model.turtles.ask(turtle => {
  turtle.forward(1)
  turtle.rotate(25)
})</div>

      <p>If you haven't already, let's add a few more turtles:</p>
      <div code-block>model.turtles.create(10)</div>

      <p>With multiple turtles in the model, we can make them interact with each other.</p>

      <p>Read this code before you run it. What do you think will happen?</p>
      <div code-block forever-button>model.turtles.ask(turtle => {
  turtle.face(util.oneOf(model.turtles))
  turtle.forward(1)
})</div>

      <h2>Patches</h2>

      <p>Patches are square regions of space that make up the world. Right now, they're all black, so you can't see them. Let's make them visible:</p>

      <div code-block forever-button>model.patches.ask(patch => {
  patch.color = ColorMap.Jet.randomColor()
})</div>

      <p>These square regions of space have been there the whole time. We just couldn't see them before.</p>

      <p>Turtles can interact with patches too! Let's ask the turtles to reset the color of the patches beneath them:</p>

      <div code-block forever-button>model.turtles.ask(turtle => {
  turtle.patch.color = 'black'
})</div>
