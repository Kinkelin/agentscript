This is a fork of the agentscript framework, that aims to create a simulation environment. The goal is to hold a coding tournament for competing strategies in the simulation.

To run the project a web server is required (for example XAMPP).

With a default XAMPP installation you can put this project in the htdocs
C:\xampp\htdocs\agentscript-master

If the server is running you can run the simlulation in any browser:
https://localhost/agentscript-master/veggieworld/veggieWorld.html
